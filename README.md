# LIF Vis model

This is the repo for integral-and-fire version of biophysical model simulation for neurons in Layer IV of Area V1 in mice.

We take two versions of integral-and-fire models in NEURON simulator (https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/), one is called 
intFire1 and the other is called intFire4 (see details in NEURON simulator website).

The original code of biophysical model simulation was created by Anton Arkhipov 
(https://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/anton-arkhipov/) in Allen Institute Brain Science.

Details of the project is described in Wiki page (https://github.com/zqwei/LIF_Vis_model/wiki).
